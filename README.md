# QOS

I administer linux systems for a living, and that involves using a lot of userland tooling, some of which I don't even think about. I want to think about them; it's time to brush up on my linux internals, so this is me making an OS in Rust. Starting with something that boots a kernel and working my way around re-learning as I go. I'll be including all my notes in notes/ and writing mini updates on https://blog.colindou.ch in order to practice writing again.

Mostly this will be pretty meandering - I anticipate that I'll get distracted a lot, and build what I find interesting at the time as I hit roadblocks and want to do interesting things. Expect dives into shells, ELF parsing, kernel module loading and more.
